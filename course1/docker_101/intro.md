### Containers

* In this scenario we'll learn the basis of containerisation.

* Containers have become the de facto compute units of modern cloud-native applications.

* Containers are often referred to as *“lightweight”* because they share the machine’s OS kernel. Containers are **unix processes**, not lightweight VMs, a container provides operating-system-level virtualization by abstracting the *"user space"*.

* [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/) is one of the most well-known and somehow highly used container engine technologies, but it isn’t the only option. There are other alternatives  like [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/).
