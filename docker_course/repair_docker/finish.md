### WELL DONE !

* Docker needs:
    - a UNIX domain socket (or IPC socket) is created at `/run/docker.sock` requiring either root permission, or docker group membership,
    - another socket `/var/run/containerd/containerd.sock` is needed to be used to talk with containerd
    - Docker engine [API Reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.41/#tag/Container)
