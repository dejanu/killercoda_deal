### Containers

* Containers have become the de facto compute units of modern cloud-native applications.

* Unlike a VM, which provides hardware virtualization, a container provides operating-system-level virtualization by abstracting the *"user space"* not the entire operating system.

* Containers are **unix processes**, not lightweight VMs, a container provides operating-system-level virtualization by abstracting the *"user space"*.

* [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/) is one of the most well-known and highly used container engine technologies, but it isnâ€™t the only option. There are other alternatives like [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/).
