### Objects

* A K8S objects is a "record if intent", almost every object has two nested fields: **object**`.spec` (desired state) and **object**`.status` (most recently observed status of the object). (don't forget to `kubectl explain ...`ðŸ˜‰)

* Most often object are represented as `.yaml` file aka manifest. Ther are 4 essential field that must be present in a manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: # which version of K8S API you're using to create the object, i.e. core API v1 / apps/v1 or v1
kind: # type of object/resource that you're creating
metadata: # metadata about the object, such as name, namespace, labels, and annotations
spec: # desired state for the object
```

* To obtain a comprehensive list of available objects/kinds/resources, simply run the command: `kubectl api-resources`{{exec}}

* To obtain a view of registered API groups and their versions, use: `kubectl get apiservices`{{copy}} or `kubectl api-versions`{{copy}}

* To view the deployments and pods running in the `playground` namespace using the objects shortname : `kubectl -n playground get po,deploy`{{exec}}

* Within the namespace there is a pod named `basic` which is NOT bound to a ReplicaSet or Deployment, commonly referred to as a "naked pod".

* To get the declarative reporesentation of the pod just execute: `kubectl -n playground get po basic -o yaml`{{exec}}, and save it to disk.

* Moreover if this pod is deleted `kubectl -n playground delete po basic`{{exec}}, it won't be automatically recreated since it's a "naked pod". Naked pods will not be rescheduled in the event of node failure: `kubectl -n playground get po,deploy`{{exec}}

* You can use apply to reference remote manifests: `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dejanu/k8s_logging/refs/heads/main/nginx_pod.yaml`{{copy}}
