### Imperative vs. Declarative 

* A Kubernetes **object** is a "record of intent" - once you create the object, the Kubernetes system will constantly work to ensure that the object exists.

* Objects are created using Kubernetes API, furthermore we'll explore the process of creating objects in an **imperative** and **declarative** fashion using `kubectl`.

* Kubernetes features a variety of object types, but *initially*, the ones you'll likely encounter the most include: Pods, Deployments, ReplicaSets, Services.
