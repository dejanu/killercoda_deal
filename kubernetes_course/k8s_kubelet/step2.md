## Static Pod

Create a naked pod named `test`, based on a `ngnix` image, and check on which node is has been scheduled.

* Mandatory fields for Pod object:
```bash
apiVersion - Which version of the Kubernetes API you're using to create this object
kind - What kind of object you want to create
metadata - Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name string, UID, and optional namespace
spec - What state you desire for the object
```

Delete the pod, and recreate it as a static pod on the control-plane node. Static pods always have a `-${NODENAME}` appended to their name, indicating which node controls the static pod.
